#Open MP
1. Write an OpenMP program to perform addition of two arrays A & B store the result in the array
C
2. Write an OpenMP program which performs C=A+B & D=A-B in separate blocks/sections where
A,B,C & D are arrays.
3. Write an OpenMP program to add all the elements of two arrays A & B each of size 1000 and
store their sum in a variable using reduction clause.
4. Write an OpenMP program to multiply two matrices A & B and find the resultant matrix C
5. Write an OpenMP program to find the number of processes, number of threads, etc (the
environment information).
6. Write an OpenMP program to find the largest element in an array using critical section.
7. Write an OpenMP program to find the largest element in an array using locks.
8. Write an OpenMP program to show how thread private clause works.
9. Write an OpenMP program to show how first private clause works.(Factorial program)
10. Write an OpenMP program to multiply two matrices A & B and find the resultant matrix C

#MPI
1. Write a MPI program to calculate and print the value of PI.
2. Write a MPI program to send the message from a process whose rank=3 to all other remaining
processes.
3. Write a MPI program where each processor sends an integer number and its rank to the master
processor, where the master gathers all the information and prints the data accordingly
4. Write a MPI program to find sum of 'n' integers on 'p' processors using point-to-point
communication libraries call
5. Write an MPI program where the master processor broadcasts a message “HELLO MSRIT” to the
remaining processors using broadcast system call.
